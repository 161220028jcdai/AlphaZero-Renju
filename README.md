5. [A renju program follow AlphaZero. ](https://github.com/junxiaosong/AlphaZero_Gomoku) [Here](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/32089487) is a chinese doc about it. I think this implement has some bugs. For example the author compute final z by mistake, but when do backup he add a negative sign, so maybe the result is ok.

### Requirements
- python 3.5+
- tensorflow==2.0.0a0
- loguru==0.2.5
- pygame==1.9.6 (needed by play.py, training doesn't need this.)

### Results
- Training about 24 hours, each move with 100 mcts simulations:

- Training about 48 hours, each move with 400 mcts simulations:
